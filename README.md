Digraph is a [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) plugin that allows you to write a lot of utf-8 characters by using your normal layout
It's heavily inspired by Vim's digraph.

After write the first character press the Digraph shortcut (default `cmd-k`/`ctrl-k`), you then press the character that you'd like to merge and boala!
Example:

  if you press  n ctrl-k ?  you will see  ñ
  if you press  E ctrl-k u   you will see €
  if you press  A ctrl-k E  you will see  Æ 
  if you press  ? ctrl-k !  you will see  ‽
